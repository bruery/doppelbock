# The Bruery - Business Application Platform  (BAP)

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bruery/platform/master/src/platform/Resources/img/bruery-logo.png "Bruery")

The Bruery Platform offers developers a bootstrap template for developing business applications, by combining the tools they need. Built in PHP5, Symfony2 full-stack and extends [Sonata Project Bundles](http://sonata-project.org), it seamlessly integrates
into [Bruery apps](https://github.com/bruery) or works entirely standalone.
Developing custom business applications has never been so easy.
